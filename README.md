# Sonar_Freq_Data_Analysis

The aim of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of detecing the differences between a rock and a mine based based on the response of 60 seperate sonar frequencies.

# Data Source:
[(https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Connectionist+Bench+(Sonar,+Mines+vs.+Rocks)]

The data set contains the response metrics for 60 separate sonar frequencies sent out against a known mine field (and known rocks). These frequencies are then labeled with the known object they were beaming the sound at (either a rock or a mine).
